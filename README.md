## Overview
I've been coding away since I graduated my coding program in March 2020. Somehow, it just hasn't felt right building apps that weren't making an impact during this global pandemic.

Whether this app raises a bit of awareness or helps someone somewhere make a more informed decision, I hope it serves a greater purpose.

Credits:  This project was possible due to the folks at JavaScript Mastery for the awesome tutorial on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls).  Kudos to them for the great video.

## Installation Steps
1. Git clone with HTTPS to your local machine ```https://github.com/JuanCodeAtATime/covid19-app.git```.
2. In root folder, run ```npm install``` to install back-end dependencies.  
3. Then,  ```cd client``` and run ```npm install``` to install front-end dependencies.

5. Lastly, run ```npm run start``` to launch in your local machine.
